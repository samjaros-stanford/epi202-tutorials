**Welcome to CHPR/EPI 202!**

We are excited you are joining us for the quarter, and we hope you are excited to get started with R. First thing's first, we need to get R and RStudio installed on your computer.

Just a quick definition of terms:

**R** - R is a program that runs on your computer to process data, run analyses, make figures, and do much, much more. You can run R on its own, but it is all text-based. When something is text based, it is sometimes hard to stay organized.

**RStudio** - RStudio is a program that runs on top of R. It gives you a nice, pretty work environment. It makes it easy to see the code you are writing, how R is running, any images you have created, what variables you have stored, and much more! Working in R without RStudio is possible and happens in large data centers, but RStudio makes life much easier.

## Before we begin, what is this weird document format?

Can you believe I made this entire tutorial...in R!?!? Well...kinda. That's more of a complicated story, but we will go into that during week 1. I am writing this tutorial in *R Markdown* which is a special file format that turns plain text into the fancy PDF that you are reading now. The extra special part is that I can include code in this document too:

```{r}
# If I put a # at the beginning of a line, R won't look at that line.
# print() sends data back to the user.
# "Hello world" is in quotes to tell R that I want the text "Hello world" and not the variables Hello and world.
print("Hello world")

# R is constantly improving and releasing new versions. Here's how you see the current version you're using.
R.version$version.string
```

Cool, right? Because R Markdown allows us to combine normal human-readable text and code, we will be using it for the pre-class tutorials and your homework. If you really want to work ahead, check out the [Epidemiologist's R Handbook on R Markdown](https://epirhandbook.com/en/reports-with-r-markdown.html) after you finish this tutorial.

## Step 1: Install R

![](images/r_logo.png)

a.  You will want to do all of this installing on a laptop that you can bring to class. That way, you can follow along with coding that we do together (and get a start on your homework!).

b.  To install R, you will use the [Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)](https://cran.r-project.org/). Click on that link or type cran.r-project.org into your browser.

c.  At the top of this website, you will see a list of installation links.

-   **If you are using Mac:** Click the link that says `Download R for macOS`. You will see a page with download links that start with `R-` and end with `.pkg`. If you have a newer Mac that uses Apple's processors (M1, M2, etc.), you will use the first link under the text `For Apple silicon`. If you have an older Mac that uses an Intel processor, you will use the link under `For older Intel Macs`. If you're not sure which one you have, [here's a nifty tutorial](https://help.arcstudiopro.com/all-how-tos/how-do-i-know-if-my-mac-has-intel-processor-or-apple-m1) on how to find that information on your computer.
-   **If you are using Windows:** Click the link that says `Download R for Windows`. Then, click on `base`. Then, click on `Download R for Windows`.
-   **If you are using Linux:** Click the link that says `Download R for Linux`. Then, select the distro you are using from the list. These links will bring you to a distro-specific tutorial for the commands need to download R.

d.  After you have downloaded the correct file for your system, click on it. If you cannot find the file, check your "Downloads" folder or try step c again. It may take a little while for the file to download and install. After you click on it, you may need to say "Yes" to allow the file to be installed on your computer. Click through the installer using the default options. Eventually, the installer will say that R was successfully installed, and you should see R on your computer.

## Step 2: Install RStudio

![](images/rstudio_logo.png)

a.  To install RStudio, you can click on [this link](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) or go to posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop in your browser.

b.  Since we already installed R in the above step, you can use the button under **2: Install RStudio** to get RStudio for your computer. The website should automatically detect what system you're using and give you the right one, but all of the different installers are available on the page if you scroll down.

c.  When it's done downloading, click on the installer and follow the prompts. You may have to click "Yes" to allow it to run on your computer. Keep following the prompts using the default options until you finish the installation. Then, open RStudio by clicking on it.

## Step 3: Check your work & take an RStudio Tour

a.  Click on RStudio to open it. It should look something like this:

If your RStudio does not look similar when you open it up, revisit steps 1 & 2 to see if something went wrong in the install. If you're having trouble, please feel free to use office hours, email, or the internet to get help with your installation.

b.  Let's look around RStudio. The big section on the left hand side is the R console. When you downloaded R in step 1, that is what you downloaded! It has all of the power of R, and everything else on your screen is just trying to make your life easier. The `>` means that R is ready to accept a command. Feel free to click in there and ask it some math problems like `2+2` or `5*4` just to make sure it is really working. You can see at the top of that big pane are the tabs "Console", "Terminal", and "Background Jobs". We will only be using the "Console" in this class, but it is good to know that there are other things there!

![](images/rstudio_console.png)

*Note:* Depending on when you read this, the top line may not say `R version 4.3.2 (2023-10-31 ucrt) -- "Eye Holes"`, especially if you're reading this in the way future!!! The top line will always be the R version you are running. As long as it says `R version` and then some numbers, you are good to go.

c.  The top right pane is our "Environment". This pane tells us about what we are working on in this project. When you save data sets or create variables, they will appear here in case you forget their names or what they contain. You can see there are other tabs in this pane too, but we will not use them in this course.

![](images/rstudio_environment.png)

d.  The bottom right pane has a lot of useful stuff in it. We will go through several of these in the course as they can be really helpful when you are making figures or need help. The tab you are probably looking at now is "Files" which is useful to save and open your code. We will be talking a look at this pane during week 1.

![](images/rstudio_files.png)

*Note:* Your files will not be the same as mine. However, you should have the same tabs at the top.

e.  There is actually a hidden 4th pane that appears when you are working on editing a file. Let's create a new file to see that pane. In the top left hand corner of RStudio, click on File \> New File \> R Script. A new pane should appear above the Console. You can use this pane to write your code and save it for future use. Go ahead and add the same lines `2+2` and `5*4` to this new file, and use the "Run" button for each line to send them to the Console.

**Congratulations!** You have installed R and RStudio, and you are ready for the first week of class. We are excited to meet you all and get you working in R!!!
